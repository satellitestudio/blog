    <h1>React, D3 and animation: One Spring to rule them all</h1>

    <cite>
      <b>
        One Spring to find them,<br>
        One Spring to bring them all<br>
        And in the transitions hook them<br>
      </b>
    </cite>
    <p>
        When building interactive data visualisation for the web, we should make a decision on a philosophical level:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
          use some kind of charting library, where we will be merely picking a bunch of predefined charts (bar chart, scatterplot, <s>pie chart</s> donut chart, etc) and change colors and fonts. Our likely output, sadly, is yet another boring and pointless dashboard;
      </li>
      <li>
          roll up our sleeves, tap into the raw power of the drawing primitives of the web we know and love: the DOM, SVG, Canvas, WebGL. Build something awesome that is faithful to the designer's vision, to the user expectations and to the underlying meaning of the data.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <figure>
      <img src="cone.png" alt=""/>
      <figcaption>
          This is a conical bivariate scatterplot, which serves as a legend to a map. Every white dot is an entity that produces a certain volume of coffee, with a given "score", representing how socially and environmentally responsible it is. The slices colors match colors on an associated map.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
        That said, if we are to proudly reinvent the wheel, we will need some tools. You should be already familiar with D3, *the* javascript data visualisation library, and probably already read somewhere that D3 is not really, in fact, about data visualisation. It is a low-level collection of tools to draw graphics in the browser, with a heavy focus on SVG (vector graphics). D3 is in fact, the sum of three things:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        An idiosyncratic way of manipulating <b>datasets</b>: the <code>enter/exit/update</code> pattern;
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>DOM manipulation</b>: generate HTML tags, attributes, styles, SVG or not, as a function of the above; 
      </li>
      <li>
        Everything that stands in between those two, most importantly <b>layouts and generators</b>, which are responsible for turning raw data values to drawing instructions that are useful for rendering. Take for instance <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-geo">d3-geo</a>, which turns geographical coordinates into drawing instructions for SVG paths.
      </li>
    </ol>


    <hr />

    <p>
      This is great and it works incredibly well for standalone data visualisations, such as notebooks or a data-focused news article, but if you are building an application, chances are you already have something in place for both manipulating data, and manipulating the DOM. In this post we'll talk about React and how to make it play nice with D3; a topic largely explored in the past (see <a href="https://medium.com/@tibotiber/react-d3-js-balancing-performance-developer-experience-4da35f912484">this blogpost for a nice detailed rundown of the possible methods</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/@Elijah_Meeks/interactive-applications-with-react-d3-f76f7b3ebc71">Elijah Meeks take</a>'s also good), but we'll add a twist: <b>animations</b>.
    </p>

    </figure>

    <h2>Title</h2>

    <p>
      The problem is that both React and D3 want control of the DOM. One method is to leave your graphics DOM manipulation to D3 in a blackbox, let React at the door, and try to hook D3 to your React component lifecycle when data changes. If you already tried integrating a Leaflet map to a React app for example, that would feel quite similar.
    </p>

    <p>
      You will end up with dealing with two completely opposite programming paradigms: a headache now, and a nightmare 3 months from now. From experience, our take is simple: <b>do not, ever, let D3 anywhere near the DOM in a React app</b>.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <p>
      Instead, we'll be taking a leap of faith and write our own DOM in React, from the most humble bar chart to the most convoluted bivariate tilegrid map (yes, <a href="https://xeno.graphics/bivariate-tilegrid-map/">it's a thing</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
      In the case of the former, we can draw things using divs, and bypass D3 entirely, apart from its very useful <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-scale">scales</a>. For more complex use cases, we will need to know some SVG basics, and use what D3 is incredibly great at: <b>the math</b>, in the form of layouts and generators, as explained earlier. This gives you full control of the presentation, while sparing you yet another StackOverflow search for that trigonometry formula.
    </p>

    <p>

    </p>

    <p>
      We will see that in action in the following examples: a radial bar chart, a sankey, and a spinning globe.
    </p>

    <p>
        But. D3 still has many things we need, and chiefly: the math. From simple things like scales, to complex layout tasks, such as projecting GeoJSON coordinates to screen space and "rendering" those into SVG path instructions.
    </p>

    <p>
        Tom McWright made a great description of this D3-React approach a while ago. The conclusion though, left us a bit frustrated:
    </p>

    <cite>
        The elephant in the room, for some, is animation. d3 is very concerned with making animation possible and its selection API reflects that fact. Personally I avoid animation whenever possible, and so I haven't invested much time getting it to work with this approach (…).
    </cite>

    <p>
        We did invest some time. Because animation, when done right (and with frugality), is a crucial part of interactive information design. Animation helps understanding the dynamic nature of a dataset. How values evolve over time, naturally, but also how they change when switching context (which also goes for UI transitions). If anything, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbkSRLYSojo">the late Hans Rosling should convince you INVOKE HIM</a>.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img src="hans-rosling.gif" alt="Hans Rosling explaining a chart with his whole body">
    </figure>

    <p>
        Transitions is a technical problem we want to tackle early on, because moving around a high number of things on a screen ties in with performance optimization and code structure.This   will have an impact on fundamental technical choices we make.
    </p>

    <p>
        The thing is, transitions in D3 are done perfectly right. In most scenarios performance is good (sans WebGL), and to say they don't get in the way is an understatement. As in, basically, just add this line of code:
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-js">
.transition()
    </code></pre>

    <p>
        But it goes hand in hand with D3's selection mechanism, which makes it a no go. The state of animation in React, on the other hand, is frankly a bit depressing, to the point where a lot of advice you can hear is: "just use CSS transitions".
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img class="small" src="no.gif" alt="Michael Schott says no">
    </figure>

    <p>
        The declarative nature of React does indeed make a nice developer experience for transitions complicated. Some of us, a long long long time ago, were doing Flash websites and got used to simple and fully programmable animation APIs, and want the same experience in React. One of us, namely Cheng Lou, 
    </p>
  
    <p>
      While it's certainly not new, I recently came across Cheng Lou's talk "The state of animation in React". I'm a gigantic fan of this talk, not the least because he talks about Flash with an absolutely brilliant brazenness. Yes, Flash was awesome. It's not today's topic, but let's leave it at this: Flash got animation right and we modern web developers ought to take inspiration.
    </p>

    <p>
      Where Cheng's react-motion cleared a path, a jewel of a library named react-spring picked up.
    </p>

    <p>
        Maps! Maps! Maps!
        Do not bring Leaflet or Google Maps or Mapbox GL if you need to do a simple statistical map like a choropleth. First,you'd be using a rouleau compressor to plant a nail. Second, you'd be forced to use a Mercator projection, which is dumb, evil and frankly gross.
    </p>

    <p>
        Pure react code feels really good
